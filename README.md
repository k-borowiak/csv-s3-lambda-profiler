# 🚀 Serverless CSV Data Profiler (AWS S3 + Lambda + Python)

## 📌 Overview

This project is a simple event-driven data pipeline on AWS that automatically processes CSV files uploaded to an S3 bucket.

Once a file is uploaded, an AWS Lambda function is triggered to parse the dataset and generate a structured JSON summary containing basic metadata and a sample row.

---

## 🔄 Workflow

1. A CSV file is uploaded to the S3 bucket (`uploads/` folder)
2. The upload event triggers an AWS Lambda function
3. Lambda reads and parses the CSV file using Python (`csv` module)
4. The function extracts:
   - number of rows
   - column names
   - sample row
   - metadata (source, timestamp)
5. The result is saved back to S3 in the `output/` folder as a JSON file

## 🧰 Tech Stack

- AWS S3 (storage + event source)
- AWS Lambda (serverless compute)
- Python 3.x
- boto3
- csv / json
